# Data Analysis Report 1

This analysis aims to understand what factors could potentially lead to derogatory reports on a personâ€™s credit history. Using data from credit card applications, we use a statistical model to tease out possible factors that contribute to the number of derogatory reports a person has. We chose a Negative Binomial regression model because it allows for easy interpretation of the model results, has a generally good fit with the data, and addresses the excess amount of applications with zero derogatory marks.

The appendix contains the code used in this analysis, and the written report outlines the results in further detail.
