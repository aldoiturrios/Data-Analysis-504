# Data Analysis Report 2

This analysis aims to analyze the results of this experimental study in order to better understand how laser treatments affect visual acuity. We also want to better understand how a patientâ€™s age of diagnosis and risk of retinopathy impact visual acuity. Given that this data is censored, we performed a survival analysis that includes modeling the probability of losing eyesight by estimating a survival function and fitting our data to a frailty model.

The appendix contains the code used in this analysis, and the written report outlines the background of the data and the results of the analysis in further detail.
